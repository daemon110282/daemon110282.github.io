# Camunda

Camunda bpm engine. Such an engine is a set of libraries, making it possible to execute predefined processes.

This approach enabled us to create a flexible and scalable architecture, which includes the following advantages:

A capability to restore the process from the point of any recent tech failure; on top of that, such a capability is available right 'from the box';

Integration of GUI enables real-time monitoring capabilities;

A capability to write unit tests focused not only on the logic and integration but also on the process itself.
